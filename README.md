# Basic Todo App Backend Server

**link is also included in the about section on this page**

The frontend app must be in vanilla Javascript. No frameworks or libraries. (ie. React, Vue, Jquery)

The backend server can use Express or other NodeJS frameworks.

The third part of this app is to add the backend. Create a server that connects to a database to store your data.

At this point you can remove the local storage and the provided initial todo objects.


# Your Todo App Backend server must fulfill the following requirements:

- The data (todos) must be stored in a database (MongoDB)

### The frontend app must use your new server to save and retrieve todos via an API.


### You may choose the design of your backend. The following are some ideas to explore, but is not exhaustive.

- ### One server to host the app and the API (Both Hosted Via Heroku)
